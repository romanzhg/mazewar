================================================================================

1. Removed rat movement delay.

 - Initially, rats also had a finite speed. However, TA suggested to remove
 this delay.

2. Moved GUID field in the packet header.
 - We decided to move the GUID field in the packet header 8 bits to the right.
 This is to make every field align with the memory boundary.

 Initially, we were thinking of using #pragma pack. But, after some research
 it seemed that this has compatibility issues and not recommended. Although
 there is a work around to accomplish this, we decided to match the alignment
 to make coding easier.

3. Packet sequence number starts from 1.
 - A minor fix to avoid initial guid conflicts.

4. Username length to 24 characters from 12.
 - We initially set the max length to 12. This was because we didn't notice
 the value in the source code and 12 bytes was the maximum payload size. TA
 mentioned that it is better to guarantee 20 characters, so we increased it to
 24.

5. Tag Key is a incremental sequence number starting from 1 instead of a
random number.
 - This was actually something already decided but slipped through our final
 review. Since random has a possibility to conflict and tag key just needs to
 be unique after each re-spawn, sequencial number is much easier to use.

6. Also use packet sequence number to detect GUID collision.
 - Initially, we didn't know that UDP multicast packets loopbacks. Since we
 need to run multiple instances in the same machine, turning off the loopback
 wasn't our option. So, we slightly improved our detection method. Not only
 looking for the same GUID, we also track the latest packet sequence number
 from loopbacks and if we receive a number that is same or less than the
 latest one, we consider this as a GUID collision.

7. USERNAME-REQUEST-ACK sending window is 500 milliseconds.
 - There is a typo in the initial document. One part says it's 1 second and
 the other says it's 500ms. 500ms is the value we want.

8. Tagged packets are saved up to 5 per opponent player.
 - We initially set this to 3 but increased to 5 because this number had a
 better explanation. It is added in the Rationale section.
